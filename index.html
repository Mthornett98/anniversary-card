                Dear Lauren(aka Lozzy, Lozzpots, Pots, Lollipop, PooBreath),

                Firstly, happy anniversary. 6 years together! CRAZY. When we first started dating, we were both only 19 years old. Since then, we have completed university degrees, landed full time teaching positions, and so much more. We have lived harmonioulsy together for multiple years, and now are travelling the world. In the past year, I have been so proud to see you develop as a graduate teacher, and am proud of your courage to take the year off to travel.I am proud that you have started your TPT shop, taking the plunge into the unknown. Being a consumer of content is easy, you risk nothing, but it takes guts to create - your doing just that. During our sixth year together, we have shared many wonderful memories. Some particularly fond memories are going to Albany together, trips to Dunsborough, Tilly's wedding, summer trips to the beach, our trip to Denmark with friends, and now taking on New Zealand! I look forward to what the next twelve months have in store for us and cannot wait for our Europe and Canadian adventures! Lauren, I am grateful for all your support, the way you graciously interact with my family (even when it can be hard), the way you unapologetically bring things to my attention that you are not happy with/about (this allows us to devise a solution and make things better), and for your resilence when things in life get tough. I love the way you get bursts of energy right when we hop into bed. I love the way we can laugh and joke around and be silly. I love how well we have gotten to know each other and sense when something is wrong. I can't wait to keep growing with you and am so excited with the direction we are both headed in. I love you so much.
                
                From Matt XXX</p>
